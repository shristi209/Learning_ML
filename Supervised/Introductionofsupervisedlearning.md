<h3>Let's first get clear on what supervised learning is?
</h3>


Supervised learning is an algorithm used to discover patterns in labeled datasets, like identifying between 'spam' and 'not spam' emails. In this example, the emails are already labeled as either spam or not spam, and the algorithm determines this by examining factors such as the sender, information, or the email's content.


Other realworld example includes:
*   Recommendation Systems based on their past activities.
*   Speech Recognition use supervised ml to understand and respond spoken language.
*   Weather Forecasting for future weather conditions
*   Face Recognition for security, access control and photo tagging on social media

Supervised Learning is divided into two types:
*   Classification
*   Regression

I will make different file for these explanations.

Now, Let's see the process of supervised learning.

In the process of supervised learning, the initial step involves collecting datasets. However, since the data often contains noise and may have missing features, data preparation and pre-processing are essential. This includes tasks like data cleaning and data visualizations to gain insights. The defining training set is crucial as it forms the foundation for training a machine learning model, containing input-output pairs that teach the model how to make predictions. The choice of the specific learning algorithm is a critical decision, and once preliminary testing shows satisfactory results, the classifier becomes available for routine use. Classifier evaluation, typically based on prediction accuracy (the percentage of correct predictions divided by the total predictions), assesses how well the model performs its classification task. This comprehensive process ensures that the model can effectively categorize new data into predefined classes based on patterns learned from the training data.
