<h3>Let's first get clear on what supervised learning is?</h3>

<h4>
Supervised learning is an algorithm used to discover patterns in labeled datasets, like identifying between 'spam' and 'not spam' emails. In this example, the emails are already labeled as either spam or not spam, and the algorithm determines this by examining factors such as the sender, information, or the email's content.</h4>



Other realworld example includes:
*   Recommendation Systems based on their past activities.
*   Speech Recognition use supervised ml to understand and respond spoken language.
*   Weather Forecasting for future weather conditions
*   Face Recognition for security, access control and photo tagging on social media

Supervised Learning is divided into two types:
*   Classification
*   Regression

I will make different file for these explanations.

Now, Let's see the process of supervised learning.

Here, the first step is collecting data sets. As the data contains noise and many missing feature of data, data preparation and data pre-processing is done. Here, we have to do data cleaning, data visualizations and all. 

The choice of which specific learning algorithm we 
should use is a critical step.
