<h2>Classification</h2>
Classification is a supervised learning technique used to categorize data into predefined classes or categories based on their features. It has various applications such as image classification and sentiment analysis.

Image Classification: Identifying objects or entities within images.
Example: Identifying animals in wildlife photos for ecological research.

<h3>Types of Classification</h3>

**Binary Classification:** Involves two classes, e.g., spam or not-spam, negative or positive reviews.
Example: Classifying emails as spam or not-spam.

**Multi-Class Classification:** Involves more than two classes, e.g., image classification with multiple object classes.Example: Identifying different species of flowers from images.

**Algorithms and Examples**
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
Algorithm: 
KNN classifies based on voting from the K-nearest data points in feature space.

Example: Classifying images of actors by comparing facial features. Higher votes for a class indicate a match, e.g., recognizing Shahid Kapoor's face in an image.

The Impact of K in KNN:

**Larger K:** Can lead to underfitting, where the model is too simple to capture relationships.

**Smaller K:** Can result in overfitting, where the model is overly complex and fits noise.

-> Optimal K should be chosen to balance between underfitting and overfitting.
