# Decision Tree

A decision tree is a supervised learning algorithm used for both classification and regression tasks in machine learning. It is a flowchart-like structure where an internal node represents a feature or attribute, the branch represents a decision rule, and each leaf node represents the outcome or class label. The tree is built by recursively partitioning the data into subsets based on the values of the input features.
